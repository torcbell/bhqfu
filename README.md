    ****PROLEGOMENA TO ANY FUTURE ART SCHOOL**** Something’s got to give. The $200,000-debt-model of art education is simply untenable. Further, the education artists are getting for their money is mired in irrelevance, pushing them into critical redundancy on the one hand and professional mediocrity on the other. Blind romanticism and blind professionalism are in a false war alienating artists from their better histories. At root, it’s a form/content problem. Arts education is divided between the practical problems of form (e.g., money: how to get it, raise it, administer it, and please the powers that control it) and the slippery problems of metaphor (e.g., education: how to learn, what to learn, why to learn).
    
    Artists are the people who spend their time figuring out how best to resolve form and content problems. That’s what we do when we stretch a canvas, edit a video, implement a social space, and develop a history. It is both reasonable and generatively ridiculous to believe that artists ought to be figuring out how arts education should work. This is the premise of BHQFU: that artists can figure this thing out.
    
    ****BHQFU IS:****
    
    A university, a space for higher education and research, a community of scholars; an expansion of the BHQF practice to include more participants (that's where U come in); and a "fuck you" to the hegemony of critical solemnity and market-mediocre despair.
    
    ****WORKING PRINCIPLES****
    
    **We believe in the artistically educational possibilities of collaboration.** Collaboration, as we mean it, means a group of concerned people come together to hash out ideas, try to figure out the world around them, and try to take some agency within its future. That’s the why and how of The Bruce High Quality Foundation. BHQFU is an attempt to extend the benefits of this collaborative model to a wider number of people.
    
    **We believe that income shouldn’t be a barrier to metaphor.** We aren’t interested in providing an economic justification for arts education (which we’ll generally define as an education in metaphor manipulation). There is something far more important at stake: our ability to reason, to resist hegemony and oppression, to participate adeptly, skeptically, humorously in the political minefield of society. So if we aren’t going to justify BHQFU economically, we can’t expect participants to do so either. Let’s not parse the margins; BHQFU will be free to attend.
    
    **BHQFU is unaccredited.** Let’s just drop the bullshit altogether. Even when they deal with markets, even when they wear suits and go to meetings, even when they act professionally, artists are not professionals. So we aren’t granting degrees or certificates, we aren’t claiming to prepare anyone to become another piece of human capital. It’s simply not a lens on life that needs anymore looking through.
    
    **Students are teachers are administrators are staff.** We believe in the value of shared creative experience and responsibility. That is why the first class we are implementing is B.Y.O.U. (Build Your Own University), a monthly class to discuss and develop admission procedures, rubrics of success, governance, etc.

    ## DEMATERIALIZE! (Beyond the Zero)
    
    ### **March 5, 2010 6-10pm**
    
    **at RECESS (41 Grand St)** A one-night event exploring the role of human behavior in the construction of meaning in art. This collaborative performance will attempt to replicate an early study on human behavior. The experiment brings together the work of John Watson, Thomas Pynchon and Barnett Newman to establish a theory of behavioral relations. By examining the structure of behavior we can foster an understanding of our own internal order. The event builds on **[an online investigation](https://web.archive.org/web/20100713005626/http://march1904.blogspot.com/)** that considers behavior modification as a form of social sculpture. The project was initiated by Stephen Wuensch.
    
    ## EDIFYING
    
    ***Edifying*** is a series of performative lectures organized by Beatrice Gross.
    
    In the lineage of Robert Morris’s 1964 performance entitled *21.3* where the artist lip-synched a film of art historian Erwin Panofsky’s 1939 lecture, this series presents a selection of contemporary performance-lectures concerned with the dramatization of knowledge and its dissemination.
    
    So far, *Edifying* has featured performative works by Ellie Ga, Pablo Helguera, Christine Rebet, and collaborative Slavs and Tatars.

    ## PHILOSOPHY OF MOTION PICTURES II
    
    **Wednesdays from 7:30 – 10:30pm**
    
    This course investigates the content and structure of films, using methodologies and concepts culled from linguistics, psychoanalysis, semiotics, anthropology, and continental philosophy. We familiarize ourselves with, and evaluate the major issues and debates within film theory while critically engaging with films from a socio-historical context that rigorously confronts the heterogeneity of meaning, interpretation, and authorship. Along the way, we also consider relevant issues in narrative theory and literary texts.
    
    **[SYLLABUS](https://web.archive.org/web/20100713005626/https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0ASPZe55ZuSCyZGZtcTZ2bV8xMTVoY3hod21nYg&hl=en)**

    ## COBRACLASS
    
    **Cobraclass** is a multi-part program that considers aesthetic principles and philosophies relating to deskilling, repetition, excess, mimicry, censured gestures, fragmentation and ritual. The main goal of this open structure is to nourish the terrain for an event. The project will involve group work with clay, actions and films, bringing together a series of seemingly un-related concepts and ideas. The duration of the bulk of the event itself can be undetermined like a Lacanian session. It could result in a series of sculptures and a film. How the end result could be made public should be discussed by the participants before and after the end of the interactive session.
    
    Organized by Sarina Basta, Simone Leigh, and Karin Schneider.
    
    For more information, contact **[sarinabasta@gmail.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20100713005626/mailto:sarinabasta@gmail.com)**.
    
    ## COMMUNITY COOKING CLUB
    
    **Wednesday, June 30th from 7:00pm to 8:30pm**
    
    Part cooking class and part art/food seminar, participants will talk about different ways to engage food in art and in life. Our first class will look at the history of artists using food as a medium, as a community binder, as a fundraising resource, and as a point of sensory information in a creative space. We will then prepare and eat simple and summer-appropriate recipes that participants can make over and over again to bring to community events like potlucks, parties, picnics, etc.

    # //On the Very Idea of Art Criticism//
    
    A discussion at La MaMa Galleria, 6 East 1st Street, in conjunction with LIVE/WORK: A Painting Show
    
    **November 18th at 7 PM**
    
    What, exactly, does an art critic do, when he or she engages in the practice of criticism? Can we understand art criticism as anything more than the mere expression of the critic’s own feelings? Why or why not?
    
    In a recent book, the philosopher Noël Carroll has attempted to identify, reconstruct, and interrogate the practice of criticism in the arts, with the aim of presenting his own account of that practice. The account that he defends is controversial and interesting and will form the basis of our discussion. After describing the details of Carroll’s view in as sympathetic a manner as possible, we shall attempt to employ it in our own practice of criticizing the works on display at La MaMa, in the hopes of discovering the strengths and weaknesses of the account that he offers.

    The Artist at Work resumes **Tuesday September 14th at 7 PM**, teaming up with the Tuesday Critique Group.
    
    The first round of this class involved a core group of people making scripts and preparing the set for each week's performances. The performances were possible thanks to the participation of a much bigger group of people who weren't necessarily even present more than once, but who dropped in to contribute their interpretations of whatever prompts they were given (including: bringing in paintings or special outfits, music, lots of improv), or assisted on set in various ways. The weekly agenda is available by email.
    
    **Thursday September 23rd at 7 PM** there will be a screening of Apichatpong Weerasethakul's Mysterious Object at Noon, Emile de Antonio's Painters Painting, and any other related narratives particpants bring in or pull up on youtube.
    
    **Shooting begins in October, at locations to be discussed.**
    
    ## XXXTREME PERFORMANCE STUDIES
    
    **[BLOG](https://web.archive.org/web/20110113151313/http://xxxtreme.tumblr.com/)**
    
    This course will present an alternative history of performance studies. Alternative 1) because we will follow “underground” works which have been routinely marginalized by museums and academia and 2) because we will deliberately construct a history containing ideological gaps in order to investigate the most morally and ethically objectionable performances of the postmodern era. We will take advantage of the liberties afforded by the BHQFU classroom to focus on works that have been considered outlaw, pornographic, taboo, and ethically objectionable. We will also discuss the way museums and academia have dealt with this type of work.
    
    You will attend live performance and check the blog periodically for updates. If you cannot make time for the readings, please take the time to at least watch the videos on the blog and do some of the exercises presented. Use the blog and the facebook as a tool to dialogue with me and other students.
    
    **All events TBA in accordance w/ visiting artists schedules. Some held on campus, some off. All announced via email, facebook, and tumblr.**

    ## MOSS – A MUSICAL LANGUAGE
    
    **Thursdays from 7–9pm. Starting October 7th**
    
    When cultures with no common language come into contact, they have to create one. The result is a pidgin language: a tiny, makeshift language that allows for basic communication. Over time pidgins can evolve into complete natural languages called creoles.
    
    In this class we will develop a musical pidgin language. English and other natural languages will be left at the door. In their place: musical instruments. As a starting point, everyone will receive 100 flashcards pairing melodic shapes and basic concepts. Over the length of the course, a new musical idiom will emerge as a side-effect of communication, as the desire to be understood magnetizes pitch, rhythm, inflection, and nuance. At its end, participants will be unconscious musical virtuosi, able to thrill crowds whenever they think aloud.
    
    All instruments including voice are welcome. Prior musical training is welcome but not necessary. Those who don't own a musical instrument have the option of purchasing a slide whistle, etc.

    ## COBRACLASS
    
    **Cobraclass** is a multi-part program that considers aesthetic principles and philosophies relating to deskilling, repetition, excess, mimicry, censured gestures, fragmentation and ritual. The main goal of this open structure is to nourish the terrain for an event. The project will involve group work with clay, actions and films, bringing together a series of seemingly un-related concepts and ideas. The duration of the bulk of the event itself can be undetermined like a Lacanian session. It could result in a series of sculptures and a film. How the end result could be made public should be discussed by the participants before and after the end of the interactive session.

    # //On the Very Idea of Art Criticism//
    
    A discussion at La MaMa Galleria, 6 East 1st Street, in conjunction with LIVE/WORK: A Painting Show
    
    **November 18th at 7 PM**
    
    What, exactly, does an art critic do, when he or she engages in the practice of criticism? Can we understand art criticism as anything more than the mere expression of the critic’s own feelings? Why or why not?
    
    In a recent book, the philosopher Noël Carroll has attempted to identify, reconstruct, and interrogate the practice of criticism in the arts, with the aim of presenting his own account of that practice. The account that he defends is controversial and interesting and will form the basis of our discussion. After describing the details of Carroll’s view in as sympathetic a manner as possible, we shall attempt to employ it in our own practice of criticizing the works on display at La MaMa, in the hopes of discovering the strengths and weaknesses of the account that he offers.

    ## DEMATERIALIZE! (Beyond the Zero)
    
    ### **March 5, 2010 6-10pm**
    
    **at RECESS (41 Grand St)** A one-night event exploring the role of human behavior in the construction of meaning in art. This collaborative performance will attempt to replicate an early study on human behavior. The experiment brings together the work of John Watson, Thomas Pynchon and Barnett Newman to establish a theory of behavioral relations. By examining the structure of behavior we can foster an understanding of our own internal order. The event builds on **[an online investigation](https://web.archive.org/web/20111106091501/http://march1904.blogspot.com/)** that considers behavior modification as a form of social sculpture. The project was initiated by Stephen Wuensch.
    
    ## EDIFYING
    
    ***Edifying*** is a series of performative lectures organized by Beatrice Gross.
    
    In the lineage of Robert Morris’s 1964 performance entitled *21.3* where the artist lip-synched a film of art historian Erwin Panofsky’s 1939 lecture, this series presents a selection of contemporary performance-lectures concerned with the dramatization of knowledge and its dissemination.
    
    So far, *Edifying* has featured performative works by Ellie Ga, Pablo Helguera, Christine Rebet, and collaborative Slavs and Tatars.

    ## DRAWING EXTENSIONS
    
    **Mondays from 7-10pm . Started September 27th!**
    
    what is drawing? this eight session course will attempt to answer this question by examining drawing as a reflexive process. Through open assignments and critique we'll explore the dynamic relationship between materials, processes, and subjects/objects that affects how we see and respond to the world.

    ## THE LANGUAGE OF LOVE: INTRO ITALIAN
    
    **Mondays from 7pm - 8:30pm starting Monday June 14th** Location: 225, Mezzanine or Upstairs (depending on NASA)
    
    This summer course (6 to 8 weeks long) will teach the basics of the Italian language, focusing on speaking more than writing or grammar. The goal is to be able to have a conversation in Italian by the end of the summer and to provide a base for further improvement if desired.
    
    Wine, food, and film might also be included!
    
    Syllabus and assignments (in the works but click below). [Syllabus](https://web.archive.org/web/20111106091501/https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AVk6vcJ_vFhbZGd4Z2R6d3RfMTBtMmdxejZmYg&hl=en)

    **[WEBSITE](https://web.archive.org/web/20111106091501/http://www.sophynaess.com/artist_at_work.html)**
    
    The Artist at Work resumes **Tuesday September 14th at 7 PM**, teaming up with the Tuesday Critique Group.
    
    The first round of this class involved a core group of people making scripts and preparing the set for each week's performances. The performances were possible thanks to the participation of a much bigger group of people who weren't necessarily even present more than once, but who dropped in to contribute their interpretations of whatever prompts they were given (including: bringing in paintings or special outfits, music, lots of improv), or assisted on set in various ways. The weekly agenda is available by email.
    
    **Thursday September 23rd at 7 PM** there will be a screening of Apichatpong Weerasethakul's Mysterious Object at Noon, Emile de Antonio's Painters Painting, and any other related narratives particpants bring in or pull up on youtube.
    
    **Shooting begins in October, at locations to be discussed.**
    
    ## XXXTREME PERFORMANCE STUDIES
    
    **[BLOG](https://web.archive.org/web/20111106091501/http://xxxtreme.tumblr.com/)**
    
    This course will present an alternative history of performance studies. Alternative 1) because we will follow “underground” works which have been routinely marginalized by museums and academia and 2) because we will deliberately construct a history containing ideological gaps in order to investigate the most morally and ethically objectionable performances of the postmodern era. We will take advantage of the liberties afforded by the BHQFU classroom to focus on works that have been considered outlaw, pornographic, taboo, and ethically objectionable. We will also discuss the way museums and academia have dealt with this type of work.
    
    You will attend live performance and check the blog periodically for updates. If you cannot make time for the readings, please take the time to at least watch the videos on the blog and do some of the exercises presented. Use the blog and the facebook as a tool to dialogue with me and other students.

    ## PHILOSOPHY OF MOTION PICTURES II
    
    **Wednesdays from 7:30 – 10:30pm**
    
    This course investigates the content and structure of films, using methodologies and concepts culled from linguistics, psychoanalysis, semiotics, anthropology, and continental philosophy. We familiarize ourselves with, and evaluate the major issues and debates within film theory while critically engaging with films from a socio-historical context that rigorously confronts the heterogeneity of meaning, interpretation, and authorship. Along the way, we also consider relevant issues in narrative theory and literary texts.

    ## MOSS – A MUSICAL LANGUAGE
    
    **Thursdays from 7–9pm. Starting October 7th**
    
    When cultures with no common language come into contact, they have to create one. The result is a pidgin language: a tiny, makeshift language that allows for basic communication. Over time pidgins can evolve into complete natural languages called creoles.
    
    In this class we will develop a musical pidgin language. English and other natural languages will be left at the door. In their place: musical instruments. As a starting point, everyone will receive 100 flashcards pairing melodic shapes and basic concepts. Over the length of the course, a new musical idiom will emerge as a side-effect of communication, as the desire to be understood magnetizes pitch, rhythm, inflection, and nuance. At its end, participants will be unconscious musical virtuosi whenever they think aloud.
    
    All instruments including voice are welcome. Prior musical training is welcome but not necessary. Those who don't own a musical instrument have the option of purchasing a slide whistle, etc.
